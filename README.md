Binary Search in a Rotated Sorted Array
Overview
This code demonstrates the implementation of binary search in a rotated sorted array in JavaScript.

Problem Statement
Given a rotated sorted array arr, find the index of a target value target using binary search.

Example
javascript
Copy code
let arr = [1, 5, 20, 50, 70, 60, 59, 10];
console.log(calculation(0, arr.length - 1, 20, arr)); // Output: 2
Function Explanation
The calculation function implements binary search to find the index of the target value in the rotated sorted array arr.

Parameters:

l: Left index of the current search range.
r: Right index of the current search range.
target: Target value to be found.
arr: Rotated sorted array.
Steps:

Calculate the midpoint mid of the current search range.
Check if the midpoint equals the target value.
If not, determine whether the current segment is part of the increasing or decreasing part of the array.
Recursively search in the appropriate half of the array based on whether it's increasing or decreasing.
Return the index of the target value if found, else return -1.
How to Use
Copy the provided code snippet.
Paste it into your JavaScript environment or file.
Modify the arr array and target variable as needed.
Run the script to see the output.
